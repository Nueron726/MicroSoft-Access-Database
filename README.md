# MicroSoft-Access-Database
I created a Asset tracking database for the Hennepin County government. Overall fun and exciting way to implement knowledge that I learned directly within the classroom.
Completed an inventory surplus and repurposing project of all equipment and supplies at Ridgedale library, determining past usage and purchasing stats for accurate equipment used versus quantity ordered.
